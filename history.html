    <p>Blueberry Hill Farm has been growing blueberries for over 80 years. In 1941, Robert W. Austin (1908–1986), a Harvard Business School professor, planted the first bushes after discovering the acidic soil in Mt. Washington was perfect for blueberries. He was right—the berries have thrived ever since.</p>
    <p>We grow several varieties of highbush blueberries: Rancocas, Jersey, and Rubel, as well as some Bluecrop and Berkeley Bluebay bushes added in the 1990s.</p>
    <h2>History of Mt. Washington, MA</h2>
    <p>The area was settled in the late 1600s by Dutch pioneers. Originally part of New York, the land became part of Massachusetts after a colonial boundary dispute was resolved. Mt. Washington was incorporated in 1779 and today remains the smallest town in the state by population.</p>
